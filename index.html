<p class="col-9">I love to learn new things and I love to learn them by execution and theory(reading). I have began my development journey now for a month, by far this is the most complex learning I have taken on. The difficulty of learning a computer programming language is one of an expert.
  Constant repitition is the key to progression, that is the key of success to learning to code. Working full-time and being a student is challenging also, findind the balance between work and life is important.
I was born in Cheyenne Wyoming but raised in Colorado Springs Colorado. Me being a first generational college student I've decided to obtain and pursue the highest degree obtainable.
I will continue to learn my current skills and learn new ones, such as coding.

Its not what you do that's most important, its why you do it that is most important.</p>
